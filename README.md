# Scene-Representation
Repository for my MSc thesis on "Scene Representation and Pre-Tagging for Autonomous Systems"


To correctly run the code within the repository, it is necessary to:

1) Be in the root directory (i.e. in the Scene-Representation folder if used: 

```bash

git clone https://github.com/MattG-bci/Scene-Representation

```


2) This repository uses relative imports hence treats other files as modules. However, the chosen file has to be run normally as a script. To do that, follow an example to run the ```test_performance.py``` script: 

```bash

python3 -m project.tests.test_performance

```
